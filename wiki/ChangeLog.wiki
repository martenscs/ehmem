#summary Change log for ehmem project

===Version 0.1 (Feb, 15 2007)===

ehcache from this version is fully compatible with ehcache 1.4 - don't need to change API usage or recompile existed code.
One major difference is new configuration parameter:
{{{
    <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"
	       store="com.danga.jmemcached.ehcache.MemcachedStore"/>
}}}

   With parameter _store_ you could specify custom store implementation that could be used instead of default `DiskStore`. Default `DiskStore` implementation will be used if custom store is not specified.

Changes in memcached client are much more solid.

  # Main package for client was changed to `com.danga.jmemcached`
  # Added maven project model.
  # Added simple stub implementation for ehcache `Store`.
  # Removed internal logger and attached `commons-logging`.
  # Added xml configuration for memcached pool - [http://ehmem.googlecode.com/svn/java_memcached/trunk/src/main/config/memcached.xml look at example]
